# Contributing to Pixeleye

Pixeleye is founded on the principle of open-source. We believe that by working together we can push the boundaries of creativity and productivity. Pixeleye is a community project, and we welcome contributions from everyone. We'd love for you to help us build Pixeleye.

## How to contribute

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Pixeleye itself.

### Reporting issues

If you encounter any bugs with the framework, please [search the issue tracker](https://github.com/pixeleye-io/pixeleye/issues) to see if it has already been reported. If not, create a new issue with as much detail as you can provide, including steps to reproduce any bugs you find.

### Feature requests

If there is a feature you would like to see included in Pixeleye, you can [create a new issue](https://github.com/pixeleye-io/pixeleye/issues) with the `feature request` label. While we can't guarantee we will implement it, we will consider all feature requests.

### Pull requests

We are always happy to receive pull requests which fix bugs or add new features. If you're wanting to tackle something big, please [get in touch](mailto:alfie.jones@pixeleye.io)

### First timers

We tag issues with [good first issue](https://github.com/pixeleye-io/pixeleye/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) to indicate those which are good candidates for people who are new to the project. If you're not sure where to start, this is a good place.

### Blogging, tutorials and examples

We actively encourage people to write blog posts, tutorials or examples which showcase how to use Pixeleye. If you've written something, please let us know and we might even promote it for you through our website and social media channels.

## Rewarding contributions

We want to be able to build a sustainable open-source project which can be worked on full-time, part-time or in spare time. Part of this is rewarding those who contribute to the project. Whilst we don't have a formal rewards program in place, we will do our best to reward those who make a significant contribution to the project once we are in a financial position to do so.
