# Get started with self-hosting

> The best and fastest way to get started with Pixeleye is to use our cloud service. However, if you want to run and manage Pixeleye on your own infrastructure, you can do so by self-hosting Pixeleye. Since Pixeleye is open-source, we would appreciate any donations to help us maintain and improve the project. [Sponsor us](https://github.com/sponsors/pixeleye-io)
